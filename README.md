**Tkinter Tile Match Game with Bot**
A simple memory matching game built using Python + Tkinter, where you play against a bot. 
The game uses real images (apple, orange, camera, basketball, coconut) instead of random symbols, giving it a clean and realistic look.

**Gameplay Overview**

- The board is 4×4 (8 image pairs).
-  You and the bot take turns flipping two tiles.
-  If the images match, that player scores a point and gets another turn.
-  The bot “remembers” previously revealed tiles to make smart choices.
-  The game ends when all pairs are matched — whoever has the higher score wins!
  
**Features**

- Real, repeated picture tiles (no random colors or shapes)
- Clean white tile backs and subtle borders for a neat look
- Smart bot opponent with memory-based strategy
- Random layout every game
- Restart button for quick replays

**How to Play**

- Click two tiles to reveal them.
- If they match, you score a point and continue.
- If not, the bot takes its turn.
- The game ends when all tiles are matched.
